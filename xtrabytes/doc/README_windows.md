# XtraBYtes v1.1.0.4

## Intro
XtraBYtes is a free open source peer-to-peer electronic cash system that is
completely decentralized, without the need for a central server or trusted
parties. Users hold the crypto keys to their own money and transact directly
with each other, with the help of a P2P network to check for double-spending.

XtraBYtes has created something called Proof of Signature which ensure that 
100% of all blocks will be signed by the system when they occur. The blocks 
are signed by the network of Master Nodes after verifying the transactions in 
the block. There are a total of 650 million XBY and there will never be more.

## Setup
Unpack the files into a directory and run xtrabytes-qt.exe.

XtraBYtes Core downloads and stores the entire history of XtraBYtes transactions;
depending on the speed of your computer and network connection, the synchronization
process can take anywhere from 15 minutes to a few hours or more.
